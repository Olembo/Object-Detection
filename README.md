# Object-Detection
This is a PyTorch Project to Object Detection.

To build a model that can detect and localize specific objects in images.
We will be implementing the Single Shot Multibox Detector (SSD), a popular, powerful, and especially nimble network for this task.

#Implementation

The sections below briefly describe the implementation.

They are meant to provide some context, but details are best understood directly from the code, which is quite heavily commented.

Dataset
We will use Pascal Visual Object Classes (VOC) data from the years 2007 and 2012.

Description
This data contains images with twenty different types of objects.
{'aeroplane', 'bicycle', 'bird', 'boat', 'bottle', 'bus', 'car', 'cat', 'chair', 'cow', 'diningtable', 'dog', 'horse', 'motorbike', 'person', 'pottedplant', 'sheep', 'sofa', 'train', 'tvmonitor'}

Each image can contain one or more ground truth objects.

Each object is represented by â€“

- a bounding box in absolute boundary coordinates

- a label (one of the object types mentioned above)

- a perceived detection difficulty (either 0, meaning not difficult, or 1, meaning difficult)
